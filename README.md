# numberguessinggame_quant
This is a game that prompts you to give it 2 numbers, then you will have to guess a number that's in between those numbers. Everything is random and you can replay after you've guessed. This is one of my earlier projects, that's why it's not as complicated as the PassGen one. Uses random, time modules.
